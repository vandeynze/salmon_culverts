# TITLE: Attach OpenStreetMap data for nearest road to culvert work site
# AUTHOR: Braeden Van Deynze
# DATE: July, 2020
# INPUTS: "culverts_full_mapping.csv"" data for culvert work site data
# OUTPUTS: Data on nearest road to culvert work site
# STATUS: Proof-of-concept operable
# PRIORITY: (1) Identify distance threshold for unclassified road (2) Expand for full data (3) Prep for sourcing

# Based on example in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47675571/r-spatial-join-between-spatialpoints-gps-coordinates-and-spatiallinesdatafra/47731067#47731067

# This script is proof-of-concept. It highlights a small selection of culverts in a small area, identifies the nearest OpenStreetMaps road to each culvert,
# then returns the distance to that road and all available data on that road from OSM.

# This program will likely need optimization (in terms of limiting search areas for nearest roads to reduce data held in memory). Examples in the link above.

# Many culverts are not near matches for roads. In post matching processing, we can flag work sites distant from roads for further classification.
