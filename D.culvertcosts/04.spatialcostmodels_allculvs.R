#' **Gap**
#'   
#' - Past looks at culverts have focused on benefits and used simplified cost models  
#' - Past looks at conservation costs have focused on land acquisition costs rather than restoration efforts  
#'   - Unique features of culvert improvement in PNW: upstream land access model, lots of streams/roads, large variation in slope and stream size  
#' - Timely b/c Washington culvert case  
#'   
#' **Research approach**
#'   
#' - Examine variability in cost levels and drivers of costs across culvert projects in PNW using statistical model  
#' - Compare levels and variability of costs to (possibly several) benefit measures  
#' - Apply model to extant culverts to compare costs/benefit distributions over...  
#'   - Space: where are high benefit, low cost culverts?  
#'   - Observed projects vs. all culverts: what kind of decision rule is distribution of projects consistent with?  
#' 
#' 
#' *RQ1:* How much variability is there in costs for culvert improvements?  
#'   
#' - Over space?  
#' - For observed projects vs. potential projects?  
#' - Relative to variability in benefits? (And implications for planning rules/future research)  
#'   
#' *RQ2:* What are drivers of culvert improvement costs?  
#'   
#' - Economic drivers: economies of scale, transaction costs  
#' - Geophysical drivers: stream features, terrain features  
#' - And are these drivers also drivers of benefits (i.e. upstream habitat quality for target species)?

# Data description ----

#' # Data description
#' 

#' The unit of observation in our data is a **culvert worksite**. These data
#' include all unique worksites associated with a culvert action in the PNSHP
#' data between 2001 and 2015. Each worksite is associated with a *project*, a
#' set of geographic coordinates, and the number of culverts at the site.
#' Projects are associated with a year, a reporting source, and a unique cost.
#' We also calculate the number of culverts associated with the project (methods
#' found
#' [here](https://vandeynze.github.io/salmon_culverts/culverts_summary.html#Appendix:_Creating_a_Consistent_Project-level_Culvert_Count)).
#' Note that a project may be associated with multiple related worksites,
#' though `r tabyl(df_culv$n_worksites) %>% slice(1) %>% pull(percent) %>%
#' percent` of worksites are uniquely identified to a project.

#'
#' Dependent and explanatory variables included in the empirical model are described below,
#' including a brief justification for inclusion. A more in-depth exploration of
#' these variables can be found in [this
#' report](https://https://vandeynze.github.io/salmon_culverts/spatial_variables_summary.html).

#' ## Cost estimates  
#'   

#' **Total costs ($USD, 2019)** is our primary dependent variable. This variable
#' is adjusted for inflation. It may include different aspects of the project
#' depending on the reporting. We consider this statistical error and account
#' somewhat for this effect by including reporting source fixed effects.
#'

#' ## Stream hydrological features  
#' 
#' - **Stream slope (% grade)**: slope of stream at road crossing can require more
#' expensive crossing design; identified via COMID matching with NHDPlus
#' attributes.  
#' - **Bankfull width (m)**: bankfull width is the preferred measure of stream width
#' at road crossing, accounting for potential width during high-water events;
#' identified via COMID matching with NHDPlus attributes.  

#+ echo=F
#' ## Road features  
#' 
#' - **Road paved (indicator)**: modification of a paved road is more expensive;
#' may also proxy for higher traffic volumes; measured via HERE road data for
#' nearest object.  
#' - **Road speed class (categorical)**: wider roads with more traffic are expected to
#' be more expensive; measured via HERE road data for nearest object; classes range from  2 (fastest) to 7 (slowest).

#' ## Terrain features  
#' 
#' - **Terrain slope (degrees)**: steeper terrain is expected to require more
#' expensive projects; measured by the
#' ~~[GTOPO30](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-digital-elevation-global-30-arc-second-elevation-gtopo30?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)
#' grid cell the worksite falls in~~ slope recorded for the *catchment* the stream is associated with, as opposed to the stream slope.
#'
#' - **Land cover (categorical)**: different land covers may be associated more
#' expensive projects (e.g. less accessible sites in forest, difficult soils in
#' welands, etc.); identified via cover with worksite coordinates and NLCD land
#' cover layer for nearest available year; here we use the broader NLCD Group
#' definition rather than the more detailed classification (see below).  
#' 
#' - **Elevation (m)**: mean elevation in meters in NHDPlus catchment.

#' ## Economic, social, and built-environment characteristics features  
#'
#' - **Housing density (units per sq. km)**: more parcels near worksite
#' introduces complexities related to site access and available areas for
#' staging, etc.; measured for the immediate catchment of stream identified via
#' matching with NHDPlus attribute data.  
#' - **Employment in ag/forestry (jobs in county)**: availability of skilled
#' labor may reduce project costs; employment data from
#' county the worksite is located in via [County Business
#' Patterns](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp.html) data.  
#' - **Employment in construction (jobs in county)**: see above.  
#' - **Distance to urban area (m)**: as a measure of access to labor and equipment,
#'  euclidean distance to the nearest census designated urban area, defined as 
#'  contiguous area with at least 50,000 residents.  
#' 
#+ echo=F
#' ## Scale and scope controls  
#'
#' - **Number of worksites associated with project (count):** addressing multiple
#' culverts under the same project may provide scale benefits, but might also
#' increase complexity; measured via PNSHP database.  
#' - **Distance between project worksites (m)**: more dispersed worksites
#' under a single project may increase project costs due to increased
#' transportation costs (and time); measured as the total euclidean distance
#' between worksites for multiple worksite projects. This variable is interacted 
#' with the number of worksites to allow flexible corrdination/scale effects.  
#' - **Action type (categorical):** PNSHP distinguishes between culvert removals
#' and culvert installations, in addition to culvert improvements (the dominate
#' category); we expect removals to be cheapest, followed by improvements and
#' installations; dummies are included when a project includes one or more
#' culverts flagged as either removals or installations.  
#'   
#+ echo=F
#' ## Fixed effects  
#' 
#' - **Year**: the year the project was completed  
#' - **Basin**: the basin (HUC6) where the worksite is located  
#' - **Reporting source**: the reporting source for the project

#' It looks like  distance between worksites and the number of culverts is
#' positively correlated, and both are negatively correlated with average
#' project costs. We would expect distance to increase costs but the
#' number of culverts to decrease costs (due to economies of scale), all else
#' equal. Disentangling these effects should be possible with
#' multiple regression.  
#' 
#' Stream slope is negatively correlated with bankfull width, which means wider
#' streams tend to be less steep. Stream slope is also positively correlated
#' with terrain slope, as mentioned earlier. None of the three are strongly
#' correlated with costs.  
#' 
#' Finally, the two employment variables are positively correlated, and
#' construction employment is positively correlated with housing density.
#' Ag/forestry employment is weakly positively correlated with measures that
#' indicate more rugged terrain such as stream and terrain slope. Housing density
#' and to a lesser degree construction employment are positively correlated with
#' costs.  
#' 
#' No variables have particularly large VIFs, suggesting little potential for
#' error-inflating multicollinearity. (A large VIF indicates that the variable is
#' strongly correlated with the other variables in the model, leading to
#' inflated standard errors and limiting the model's usefulness for prediction
#' or inference.)

#'
#' In addition to the fully specified model (mod_full), we present nine
#' alternative models that include different fixed effects configurations or
#' only sub-samples of the data focused on basin or reporting source criteria.
#' For basins, we provide results estimated on a "core" group representing the
#' five most frequently represented basins (Washington Coastal, Puget Sound,
#' Southern Oregon Coastal, Northern Oregon Coastal, Willamette). Finally, we
#' also estimate the model on only projects reported by OWRI and WA
#' RCO, to examine how the two sources who report the most projects influence
#' the overall results.
#' 

#' The resulting coefficients for the fixed effects and categorical variables,
#' when exponentiated, can be interpreted as the ratio of average costs for that
#' group relative those of the base group. Results for continuous variables are
#' presented as exponentiated average marginal effect of a single standard
#' deviation change, which can be interpreted as the ratio of costs relative to
#' a worksite with a standard deviation lower for the variable.

#' ## Model fit discussion  
#'

#' The full model has an adjusted R-squared of `r mod_full %>% glance() %>% pull(adj.r.squared) %>% round(3)`,
#' indicating a decent model fit. The version of the model with no fixed effects has an adjusted R-squared of
#' `r mod_nofe %>% glance() %>% pull(adj.r.squared) %>% round(3)`, indicating that a
#' significant amount of variability is explained by the additional explanatory
#' variables. When fixed effect categories are removed, we can check which fixed
#' effects explain the most variation relative to each other. It looks like
#' reporting source accounts for the most variation, followed by basin then
#' year, based on the relative R-squareds of models where each is removed and
#' where each is included on its own.
#' 

#' We can also compare AIC and BIC; the model with only fixed effects for
#' reporting source is preferred on the basis of BIC, which includes a stronger
#' penalty for the number of estimated parameters, while the full model is
#' preferred on the basis of AIC. We use the full model in what proceeds as the
#' preferred model.  
#' 

#'
#' When the model is fit only on culverts in the "core" basins or sources,
#' adjusted R-squared falls dramatically. This may suggest that information from
#' the additional sources and outside the core basins improves the fit of the
#' model.

#' We can repeat the exercise for the number of worksites and total distance
#' between worksites to examine the trade-off between economies of scale from
#' grouping multiple worksites under one project and increased costs in
#' coordination as proxied by total distance between sites. The contours of this
#' cost surface can be interpreted as the distance limit for which adding an
#' additional worksite to a project is associated with economies or
#' dis-economies of scale.
#' 

#' For example, consider a potential project with one worksite (indicated by
#' **X**) considering expanding to include a second worksite located 5km away
#' (indicated by an **\***). Because the second worksite would increase the total
#' distance between worksites below the distance where the cost contour
#' (indicated by the solid line, with dashed lines indicating a 95% c.i.)
#' crosses two worksites, expanding the project would be associated with
#' economies of scale.
#' 

#' That these contours tend to be quite steep initially indicates strong
#' potential for economies of scale when opportunities to group nearby worksites
#' under a single project arise. As the number of worksites increases, these
#' contours flatten, indicating that the maximum distance for an efficient
#' additional worksite drops quickly.  
#' 

#' ### Continuous variables  
#' 

#' To display how costs vary across the continuous explanatory variables, we
#' plot average marginal effects. These are scaled to a standard deviation
#' change for each variable. Average marginal effects are calculated with other
#' variables held at their means, which is most relevant for slope and bankfull
#' width for which the model allows an interaction effect. The resulting
#' estimate is exponentiated so that it can be interpreted as the expected ratio
#' of costs resulting from a standard deviation change in the continuous
#' variable.

#' A standard deviation increase in number of worksites is associated with 46%
#' lower average costs in the preferred model when other variables, most

#' hand, a standard deviation increase in distance between worksites is
#' associated with average costs 13% higher, though this marginal effect is not
#' statistically different from zero. This conflict is at the core of the
#' managerial tradeoffs to consider when grouping worksites under a single
#' project, as described in the preceeding section. That the negative
#' association between costs and the number of worksites exceeds the positive
#' association with total distance for the mean project suggests that there are
#' unexploited opportunities for economies of scale.
#'
#' The average marginal effects for all population features are insignificant in
#' the preferred model. However, in some of the alternative models, housing
#' density and distance to urban area has a slight positive association with
#' costs. The housing density effect might be evidence of increased access costs
#' due to negotiating with multiple landowners, while the distance association
#' may be evidence of increased costs due to lack of access to materials or
#' labor. We are in the process of gathering improved proxies for each of these
#' potential mechanisms.  
#' 

#' Bankfull width and stream slope both have positive associations in the
#' preferred models. A standard deviation increase in either is associated with
#' about fifty percent higher average costs when the other is held at its mean.
#' As seen in the earlier figure and raw coefficients, this effect is driven
#' largely by the interaction term in the model.
#'
#' Finally, a standard deviation increase in the terrain slope of the catchment
#' the worksite is located in is associated with 19% higher costs. That is,
#' culverts in hillier or more mountainous areas are more expensive to improve.
#' On the otherhand, higher eleveations are associated with lower costs, though
#' this relationship is not statistically significant.  
#' 

#' ## Fixed effects and categorical variables  
#'   

#' We can examine the fixed effect estimates to compare relative expected costs
#' across groups. We do this by exponentiating the point estimates. The
#' resulting value can be interpreted as the ratio of costs in a given group
#' relative to a base group.

#' # Benefit - cost visualizations  
#'   

# ____ Benefits and costs plots ----
#' As a simple examination of what kind of decision rule might be in play for
#' determining which culverts were selected, we plot as a benefit proxy total
#' upstream length (in km) versus observed cost per culvert. Under a
#' cost-targeting rule, all worksites would be to the left of a cost threshold,
#' while for a benefit-targeting rule all would be above a benefit threshold. A
#' benefit-cost ratio standard would be above an upward sloping line.  
#' 

#' It should be acknowledged there are severe limitations to this application.
#' Most obviously, without including data on un-attempted projects we are left
#' assuming the total possible project space is "dense" (i.e. in any point in
#' cost-benefit space we don't observe a project, we assume a project there
#' would be possible). This assumption can be addressed by incorporating data
#' from state agency culvert inventories. Second, our benefits measure is rough
#' at best, and alternative measures that account for upstream/downstream
#' barriers as well as habitat conditions and species ranges may more
#' realistically describe the decision space. Finally, in looking across
#' projects from the full study area, we may miss heterogeneity in targeting
#' rules across jurisdictions or regions. We partially address this final point
#' by also examining the distributions of subsets of worksites by region and year.

#' No evidence that projects are selected on cost or benefit-cost ratio basis.
#' It does somewhat appear that the observed projects follow a benefit targeting
#' pattern with a fairly low benefit cut-off. For Lower Columbia, Upper
#' Columbia, and Washington Coastal basins, there appears to be a slight upward
#' tilt in the higher-cost region, indicating that benefit-cost targeting may be
#' more frequent for higher-cost projects.  
#' 

#' Adding culverts where no project is observed with costs predicted via the
#' above models could reveal where observed projects exist in the space
#' relative to the universe of potential projects, which should provide more
#' clarity to the above analysis.  

#+
#' # Conclusions  
#' ## Key findings  
#'   

# Key findings ----

#' 1. Stream features slope and bankfull width increase average costs, especially when they are both high.  

#' 2. Paved roads are more expensive to improve, while other road variables have little discernible effect.  

#' 3. Some evidence of economies of scale, in that worksites associated with
#' projects associated with more worksites tend to have lower average costs.
#' This effect is countered by a postive association between costs and total
#' distance between worksites.  

#' 4. John Day basin worksites are the lowest cost and lowest variance in costs
#' between worksites. However, the model error is also highest in this basin.
#' Costs are highest in the Southern Oregon Coastal and Washington Coastal
#' basins. Cost variance is also particularly high in the Upper Columbia.  

#+
#' ## Next steps  
#'   
# Next steps ----
#' 1. More variables: additional population proximity measures, including distance to materials suppliers (gravel, pavement, metal, machinary, etc.) and parcel density data  
#' 2. Improved benefit estimates: total upstream distance by species and habitat use, accounting for upstream/downstream blockages, habitat potential measures, etc.  
#' 3. Forecast costs/benefits for culvert inventories from Oregon and Washington  
#' 4. Integrate Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient analysis from Babcock et al. (1997) for more consistent comparison between cost and benefit concentration among worksites  
#' 5. Highlight distribution of high-benefit/low-cost projects relative to traditional tribal lands, different recreational fishing areas, etc.  
#' 6. Analyze how outcomes (cost/benefit targeting efficiency relative to ratio targeting, cost levels/variation, model uncertainty) across culvert ownership, jursdictions
