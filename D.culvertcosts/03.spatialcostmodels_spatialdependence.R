# Introduction ----

#' Because of the spatial nature of the culvert worksite data, we suspect there
#' may be different forms of spatial associations within the data. These
#' associations may undermine the assumptions of our base OLS models. We use
#' three tools to measure spatial heterogeneity and dependence in the cost data.  
#'   

#' 1. Variograms: these plots display how the "semivariance" (half the variance
#' of the differences between all points within a given distance, a measure of
#' variance within a buffer) changes as a function of distance between
#' observations.  

#' 2. Moran's I: this is a test of spatial autocorrelation, where a rejection of
#' the null hypothesis indicates a violation of the OLS assumption of
#' independent observations.

#' 3. Anselin's Lagrange Multiplier Tests: these tests serve as an assessment of
#' model misspecification due to spatial associations.  
#' 

#' We use these tools on the base model found in [this
#' report](../spatial_cost_models.html), with one key change. After initial
#' testing, we found including spatial fixed effects like `basin` along side
#' band-based spatial weighting schemes (i.e. those that enforce a strict
#' maximum distance beyond which weights are zero) can result in a singular (or
#' at least computationally singular) covaraite matrix. We also found that
#' including `distance to nearest urban area` or other density-based variables
#' based on distance to fixed points (i.e., the supplier density variables)
#' result in similar singularities, likely because they closely track the same
#' processes which spatial weighting structures are intended to account for.
#' **Therefore, the `basin` fixed effect, `distance to nearest urban
#' area`, and all four of the supplier densitiy variables are removed in the models
#' presented and examined below.**

# Variograms ----
#' # Variograms  
#'   

#' A variogram is used to identify the distance at which the variance within a
#' buffer is roughly equivalent to the variance over the entire space. This
#' distance will then be used to define which points are considered "neighbors"
#' and which are not.
#'
#' We construct variograms for both the dependent variable (`log(cost per
#' culvert)`) and the model residuals to investigate spatial dependence in both
#' costs and the model's errors.

# Spatial dependence tests ----
#+
#' # Statistical tests of spatial dependence
#' 

#' We use the 20km range established using the above variograms to construct
#' four spatial weighting matrices:  
#'   

#' 1. *Distance band specification (Band)*: weighting matrix is zeros and ones, where *w~ij~* =
#' *w~ji~* = 1 when *worksite_i* is within 20km of *worksite_j* (assumes all neighbors
#' within buffer have equal dependence).  

#' 2. *Inverse distance decay specification (Decay)*: weighting matrix is *w~ij~* = *w~ji~* = 1/*d~ij~*
#' where *d~ij~* is the distance between *worksite~i~* and *worksite~j~* (assumes
#' dependence decays with distance).  

#' 3. *Hybrid specification (Hybrid)*: weights are inverse distances when worksite pair is
#' within buffer, and zero otherwise.  

#' 4. *Inverse distance decay with time specification (Decay_t)*: weights are as the
#' inverse distance decay specification but distances are only computed between
#' worksties that share the same project year. This essentially imposes a restriction 
#' of no between-year spatial effects.  
#'   

#' For each of these sptail weights specifications, we perform a suite of tests of spatial dependence.  
#'   

#' 1. *Moran's I tests*: these tests, performed on both the dependent variable (MoranDep)
#' and the residuals from the model (MoranResid), identify spatial dependence, where the
#' null is no spatial dependence (i.e., distribution over space as good as random).  

#' 2. *Anselin's Lagrange multiplier tests*: these tests of linear restrictions
#' identify mispecification due to spatial dependence, distinguishing whether
#' the source is due to missing spatial lags of the dependent variable or
#' missing spatial error structure, or both. Per Anselin's suggestion, we
#' consider the robust tests only if both simple tests reject the null.  

#'    - *LM test against error (LMerr)*: tests against the null of no spatial error.  
#'    - *LM test against lag (LMlag)*: tests against the null of no spatial lag structure.  
#'    - *Robust LM test against error (RLMerr)*: a version of LMerr robust to the presence of spatial lag.  
#'    - *Robust LM test against lag (RLMlag)*: a version of LMlag robust to the presence of spatial error.  
#'    - *LMtest against Spatial Autoregressive Moving Average (SARMA)*: tests against the null of neither spatial error nor spatial lag.

#' # Spatial econometric models

#' Here we present three Cliff-Ord type spatial models, one for each spatial
#' weighting scheme. Based on the preceding tests, we estimate these models with
#' both spatial lag (lambda) terms. We estimate these models via a GMM estimator
#' that accounts for heteroskedastic errors of unknown form ([Kelejian and
#' Prucha 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2009.10.025)).  
#' 

#' Unfortunately, these estimators do not behave well when other distance-based
#' variables, including the distance to the nearest urban area, density of
#' suppliers, and the basin fixed effect.
#' Therefore, these variables are omitted from these specifications.

#'   

#' The spatial dependence parameters on all models are positive and
#' statistically significant, indicating positive spatial spillovers from nearby
#' projects. The positive lambdas indicate that more expensive worksites
#' in one location drive up costs nearby. These spillovers are present both 
#' between years and within years, as indicated by the positive lambda estimate 
#' when the time-dependent weights are used.    
#' 

#' Because the spatial lag parameter is non-zero, we cannot interpret the
#' coefficents as direct marginal effects as we would the OLS coefficients. A
#' change in any of the explanatory variables at one worksite impacts not only
#' the worksite's costs, but also costs at neighboring worksites, which in turn
#' impact costs at the original site. To account for these feedbacks, we can
#' calculate direct, total, and indirect effects. A variable's direct effect is
#' the effect (in terms of a cost multiplier) of a single unit increase at one
#' worksite on the costs at that same worksite, averaged over all worksites. A
#' variable's total effect is the effect of a single unit increase at one
#' worksite on costs across all worksites, averaged over all worksites.
#' 

#' Note that a "unit" change in different variables can be quite dramatic. For
#' example, slope is measured on a unit interval though only really ranges fro 0
#' to about 0.3, so a unit change would be an unrealistic range to expect within
#' the data. In the future, these effects calculations will be scaled to a
#' standard deviation change rather than unit change where appropriate to aid in
#' interpretation.  
#' 

#' These calculations are dependent on the spatial structure of the data, and
#' therefore should be interpreted with the following caveat. The worksite data
#' in PNSHP is not comprehensive for all culvert projects in the region during
#' the time period. Because we cannot identify where projects absent in the database were,
#' we cannot fully model the feedback effects that may occur with missing projects in the
#' data. Therefore, I believe these effect calculations will be of limited use.

# Conclusion ----


#' # Closing Thoughts  
#' 

#' Overall, the spatial econometric methods have little effect on inference
#' regarding the explanatory variables. However, their inclusion does account
#' for an additional source of unobserved variance in the OLS models, while the
#' specific GMM methodology provides robustness against heteroskedastic errors.
#' The spatial parameters themselves provide additional richness to the
#' interpretation of the model. However, given the sparseness of our data, I
#' believe these models are of limited use. Interpreting feedback effects seems
#' particularly challenging, and prediction methods for out-of-sample points are
#' still not particularly well developed. (Definitely no off-the-shelf tools.)
