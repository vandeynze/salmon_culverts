\section{Project YR 1 (10/1/21-6/30/22)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Salary Cost
\begin{itemize}
\item  \$XXX is requested for 1 month of effort from PI Jardine. Jardine will serve as the lead administrator of the grant where administrative responsibilities include organizing meetings both internally and with the scientific advisory board to ensure the project is on track to deliver work products on time, tracking project performance, facilitating project design decisions, and supervising and mentoring the postdoctoral scholar and the two Research Assistants (one funded with PSP funds and the other with leveraged SMEA funds). PI Jardine will also provide technical assistance with optimization in R and developing the R Shiny app including providing template code for various optimization algorithms along with sensitivity analyses and model selection, and providing template code for the DST user app features.
\item \$XXX is requested for 9 months of effort from co-PI and postdoctoral scholar VanDeynze. VanDeynze will co-administer the grant, with PI Jardine, where administrative responsibilities include organizing meetings both internally and with the scientific advisory board to ensure the project is on track to deliver work products on time, tracking project performance, facilitating project design decisions, and mentoring the two Research Assistants. Co-PI Van Deynze will also assist with developing and deploying the optimization algorithm and the R Shiny app. As a post-doctoral research associate, co-PI Van Deynze will receive training from PI Jardine in the development of applied optimization algorithms, in project administration, and in mentorship of students, furthering development as an independent researcher. 
\item \$XXX is requested for 9 months of effort from a post-graduate Research Scientist. The Research Scientist will develop the habitat quality index under the supervision of PI Scheuerell. Efforts include reviewing the relevant literature, gathering data, calculating the index, and documenting all analyses such that they are reproducible.
\item \$XXX is requested for 4.5 months of effort of a graduate student Research Assistant. The Research Assistant will utilize the optimization framework to explore the research questions identified in the Project Narrative as a basis for a thesis, exploring the research questions laid out in the proposal.
\end{itemize}
\item Benefits
\begin{itemize}
\item Fringe benefits are charged at the standard UW rates of 23.6\% for faculty, postdoctoral scholars/research scientists and 20.3\% for graduate student research assistants. 
\end{itemize}
\item Overhead
\begin{itemize}
\item FILL OUT
\end{itemize}
\item Supplies
\begin{itemize}
\item We have budgeted \$2,000 for a laptop computer for PI Van Deynze based on the cost (Education Pricing) of a MacBook pro with 16 GB of RAM and 1 TB of storage. Van Deynze?s current postdoctoral position at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center and associated access to a laptop computer will end prior to the project start date and thus a laptop computer is needed for the entire project period.
\end{itemize}
\item Travel
\begin{itemize}
\item We have budgeted \$500 for a one-day field trip to allow the project team to visit multiple barrier restoration projects throughout theCase Area representing high-, medium- and low-cost projects. Associated field trip costs include vehicle transportation costs, fuel cost (estimated at \$45), and per-diem meals and incidentals expenses for the PI, co-PIs, and two students (7 people * \$57.00 ? \$400).
\end{itemize}
\item Other direct costs
\begin{itemize}
\item We have budgeted \$3,000 for Workshop 1, held at the beginning of Year 1, is intended to uncover the objectives and challenges in culvert barrier replacement for key user groups and present our proposed framework and online tool to solicit feedback. The workshop will also assist our research team with cultivating a strong professional relationship within the community of stakeholders engaged in working on fish passage in the state of Washington. Workshop costs include event facility rental (estimated at \$440 based on the Walker Ames Room at the University of Washington campus), catering including breakfast, lunch, and snacks for ? 45 participants (estimated at \$34.50 per person * 45 participants = \$1552.5 based on an estimate from Arista Catering in Seattle), and the reimbursement of transportation costs for participants needing reimbursement (\$1,007.5 budgeted for transportation cost at \$22 per person).
\end{itemize}
